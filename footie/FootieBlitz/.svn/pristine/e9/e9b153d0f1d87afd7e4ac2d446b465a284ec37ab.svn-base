== Introduction ==
When you log in to Footie after creating your account, you will be directed to the Office page, where you can create a new player.

<br /><br />

== Player Cost == 
It costs 25 User Points (UP) to create one player. You start your agent career with 100 UP and can create 4 players from those. <br />
How do I get more UP? You ask Ulrik or Rune, or write a pm to footieman. We are considering other options, like paying real money for more UP, (though we're not keen on introducing the paying aspect into Footie), but if you have another suggestion, make a post on the forums. We love suggestions.
<br /><br />

== Player Points ==
The number of points your player is made of, player points (PP) is what decides if your player is the next star. You can affect your PP by adjusting your age, or choosing one of Young Gun or Late Bloomer (Young Gun and Late Bloomer is not integrated into the new site yet).<br />

<br /><br />

== First name & Last name ==
Choose a name for your player. Please choose a realistic name, and if you can't do that, please refrain from anything too offensive or random.
<br /><br />

== Age ==
How old your player is when he hires you as his agent. Age also affects the number of player points (PP) your player has to start with.<br />
From 14-15, 15-16, 16-17 years of age, the player recieves a bonus of 75 PP per added year.<br />
From 17-18, the players recieves a bonus of 60 PP.<br />
If you have chosen either Young Gun or Late Bloomer, the number of PP you recieve for added years, is affected.
<br /><br />

== Height ==
The height of your player decides where, on the z-axis, he can interact with the ball. The Jumping attribute also plays a part in this. A shorter player gets an "invisible" boost to his agility because of his lower center of gravity.
<br /><br />

== Attributes ==
This is the core of your player. What defines him as a footballer. You buy up your players attributes with PP. A player can have a minimum score of 10 in any attribute, and a maximum score determined by his age, max. 90 at 19 years. Attributes can only be improved above 90 by match experience.<br />
From 10 to 50 each attribute point costs 1 PP.<br />
From 50 to 60 each attribute point costs 2 PP.<br />
From 60 to 70 each attribute point costs 4 PP.<br />
Above 70 each attribute point costs 6 PP.<br />
<br /><br />

== Young Gun or Late Bloomer? (not implemented on the new site) ==
You don't have to choose any of these. Not choosing either Young Gun or Late Bloomer will give your player a more evened out progression.<br />
'''Young Gun'''<br />
Your player develops faster at a younger age, than most other players. From 14-17 each added year will give him a bonus of 36 PP. When he reaches maturity, he will not progress as fast as other players of his age. This choice is for the gamblers. This player will recieve less PP than other players, so he has to use his early advantage to earn himself playing time, and even out the later disadvantage.<br />
'''Late Bloomer'''<br />
Your player develops slower at a younger age, than most other players. From 14-17 each added year will give him 36 PP less than the usual player, and 72 less than a Young Gun. When he reaches maturity, he wil progress faster than other players of his age. This player recieves more PP than any other player type, but he won't get them before he reaches maturity, and will therefore be at a disadvantage in his early years.
<br /><br />


== Advantages & Disadvantages ==
On the To-Do list. Advantages and Disadvantages are supposed to spice the game up, both with special skills to use on the pitch, and exciting options outside, to add more flavour to your player.
